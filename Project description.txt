Image viwer package;

The idea is to create a graphics interface that lets you open pictures from a folder and
lets you easaly go to picutes from another folder simply by selecting a name/tag for the pictures in that folder.
Once you double click a label containning the folder it opens the image with the default image viewing program on your OS.
Curenltly the project is at its roughf state and some things dont really work fully the way they sohould. Need to find time to fish it.

Save images package:

The idea is to combite this frama with the one mentioned above letting you save images from a url more easyly than having to deal with the web browser to do so.
Main disadvantage of this that you do need the image URL witch not all might be able to get at times.
Core idea is finished but it still needs some work to be as optimal as posible and to work as fast as posible.
